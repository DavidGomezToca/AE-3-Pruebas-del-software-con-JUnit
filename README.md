# _JUNIT TESTING_

![THUMBNAIL](resources/img/Thumbnail.png)

- **Description :**

  This project focuses on conducting simple tests using JUnit, a popular testing framework for Java. Through a series of exercises, I've implemented unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components and methods within the codebase. Each test is designed to validate specific behaviors and edge cases, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the software. By practicing with JUnit, I've honed my skills in writing effective test cases, handling assertions, and interpreting test results. This project serves as a practical learning experience for mastering the fundamentals of unit testing in Java.
